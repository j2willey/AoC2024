These are my personal leaderboard times. Rank is my position on that leaderboard:
So far I haven't "scored" (been in the top 100 worldwide for speed), but I'm OK
with that as I'm not a competitive programmer.  My goal is to get an improved
"Rank" perhaps getting in the top 1000 sometime during the challenge. But
honestly getting in the top 5000 would be great.

Day 6 Part 2 was an albatross for me.  I had an 'almost' working solution
with an hour.  But it took me 3 days, and borrowing someone else's solution
from the web to compare my code output to before I could fix and complete
my own solution.   I discovered I'd confused my x and y coordinates, but
that was not my problem as I was consistent.  When I discovered that issue
I partially fixed it and broke my algorithym 8-/.  After straightening out
my x,y coordinates and comparing my traverse and obstacles with a correct
solution... I realized my algorythim was not checking for placing an obstacle
diagonally next to an existing obstacle... forcing 2 turns in a row... DOH!
Once I saw that, it was a quick fix.

Day 9 brought back memories of a college assignment. (I think it was for
datastructures in Ada?)  I had only one final in June, holding me back a
week from leaving for my summer job on firefighting on the Tahoe Hotshots.
I asked my professor to allow me to take the final early.  Rather than take
the final he gave me an option to do a project in lieu of the final.  Write
a disk scheduler... with an algorythm for reading, writing and updating
files on a disk.  I vaguely remember that.  And I was able to leave the
week before finals!

Day 10, my fast time and best ratings yet! Yeah.  My first implementation
unknowingly at the time solved Part 2. After _rereading_ the problem
description I had to fix it for Part 1.  Then when part 2 was revealed,
I had to rewrite the original implementation.  8-)

Day 11, I should have been faster on both parts.

Day 12. Late start as we had Scouts last night.  I'm pleased with my solutions.

Day 13. Maths is hard....  Late start after another Scout meeting...
quick solution with linear search for part 1.  Much to slow for Part 2.
Quickly tried to create a binary search which didn't work.  I was too
tired to mathematically solve, so went to bed.  This morning I worked
through the two equations, two unknowns, solve for one, then the other.
(after a couple of mistakes and fixes 8-) Found the correct solution...

Day 14.  Sometimes it is better to be "Lucky" than Good....
Took me longer than it should have to complete the solution for part 1
Silly, stupid mistakes.
Part 2... Brute Force, but I think clever, and definitely LUCKY...
I figured a Christmas Tree would likely be "symmetric"... Turned out it
wasn't, at least in the way I was counting on.  None the less I got lucky.
I was building maps and searching for lines with symmetry and printed out
any map with more than 6 lines symmetric.  While the Tree itself was not
symmetric in the map,  it consolodated so many "robots" in the tree, that
there were atleast 6 blank lines elsewhere in the image that were recognized
as "symmetric", and the whole map printed so I could find the Needles of
ac Christmas Tree in the Haystack of seconds!!! LoL!

Day 15.  Had a OA Holiday Party last night.  By the time I got home
I was only able to code reading in and printing the Map and directions.
This morning and to prepare for a CoH, and was only able to get back
to the problem this evening.  At least I solved it befpre 24 hours
and I can directly attack tonights challenge.  8-)

Day 16: Solution for Part 1 was straightforward.  For Part my code was
way too slow. Then it took a while to get the bugs out.... 8-(

Day 17:  FINALLLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHHH!.     I love the premise of this problem, and it took me way
to long to solve part 2.  A couple of misguided attempts and a lot of
bugs in my code....  but finally worked through with what I think was
an elegant and fast solution....  needs to be cleaned up, but its
time to move on to day 18, which I'm almost 26 hours late starting....
Onward Ho.... !!!   Had another Scout meeting last night which
gave me a late start on Day 17...

Day 18:  Considering it took me almost two days (clock time) to finish
Day 17, I'm happy this was easier and I finish quickly.  My overall
rank is way down as I did not start until an hour ago. Its done.
Now I get a breather and head off to another meeting before tonights
challenges...

Day 19:  Easy Peasy.  Took my time before starting... Started about
9:45.  Should have started earlier and could have had a much better rank.
Tired.  Time to get some sleep.
Good day. Finished Day Part 2, Day 18 parts 1 and 2 and Day 19 1 and 2
in the couple hours...

Day 20:  Was stumped on part 2.  Finally solved it.  Nothing to be proud
of, but I finally got it done.

Day 21: (2 hours into Day 23....)  Between other holiday entanglements...
I struggled with this one.  I had hard coded implementation for part 1
that I could not get providing the correct answer for puzzle input though
it worked flawlessly on the given test data.  I was stumped for 2 days
trying to figure it out,  finally looked at reddit, and wound up
reimplementing someone else solution in my own hand...  And in the process
got the solution for part 2 included.  I'm now two days behind.
Will try to catch up tomorrow after sleep.
      (really its already Day 23, will move on to 22 tomorrow)....
      fwiw... this is the solution I reimplemented from...
      https://github.com/mattbillenstein/aoc/blob/main/2024/21/p.py

Day 22:  Okay, catching up... I'm happy with my solution and implentation.
Problem wasn't too difficult... It all comes down to reading 8-)
but I got them bananas ...

Day 23:  Keeping the streak alive...  all problems solved.

Day "24":  Post Christmas, finally solved part 2.  Took way too long. Also
the typical holiday distractions and interuptions.

Day "25":  "...I coulda been a contenda..."
No.. seriously no.  I'm not a competitive coder.  However If I'd had
a little more time... I could have had better rankings.  I should have
finished days 24 nd 25 on Christmas day.  All in all, its been fun.
I may come back to the repository and clean up the code just for practice.
But as of now,  all 50 puzzles are solved.  Yeah.

  Day 25 + 1....
  During the AoC Challenge I was focused on solving each challenge as its own effort.  As time went on I realized it begged for a more coordinated effort
  between challenge.   I couldn't let go... and in my 'free' time post challenge
  went back and created a top level program to call and verify each challenge.
  I realize I should have done this from the beginning and will take that on
  for future challenges... Better late than never.

with a few glaring exceptions, I think most of my solutions were
pretting reasonable and efficient.
