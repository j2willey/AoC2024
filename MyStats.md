These are my personal leaderboard times. Rank is my position on that leaderboard:
So far I haven't "scored" (been in the top 100 worldwide for speed), but I'm OK
with that as I'm not a competitive programmer.  My goal is to get an improved
"Rank" perhaps getting in the top 1000 sometime during the challenge. But
honestly getting in the top 5000 would be great.

Day 6 Part 2 was an albatross for me.  I had an 'almost' working solution
with an hour.  But it took me 3 days, and borrowing someone else's solution
from the web to compare my code output to before I could fix and complete
my own solution.   I discovered I'd confused my x and y coordinates, but
that was not my problem as I was consistent.  When I discovered that issue
I partially fixed it and broke my algorithym 8-/.  After straightening out
my x,y coordinates and comparing my traverse and obstacles with a correct
solution... I realized my algorythim was not checking for placing an obstacle
diagonally next to an existing obstacle... forcing 2 turns in a row... DOH!
Once I saw that, it was a quick fix.

Day 9 brought back memories of a college assignment. (I think it was for
datastructures in Ada?)  I had only one final in June, holding me back a
week from leaving for my summer job on firefighting on the Tahoe Hotshots.
I asked my professor to allow me to take the final early.  Rather than take
the final he gave me an option to do a project in lieu of the final.  Write
a disk scheduler... with an algorythm for reading, writing and updating
files on a disk.  I vaguely remember that.  And I was able to leave the
week before finals!

Day 10, my fast time and best ratings yet! Yeah.  My first implementation
unknowingly at the time solved Part 2. After _rereading_ the problem
description I had to fix it for Part 1.  Then when part 2 was revealed,
I had to rewrite the original implementation.  8-)

Day 11, I should have been faster on both parts.

Day 12. Late start as we had Scouts last night.  I'm pleased with my solutions.
